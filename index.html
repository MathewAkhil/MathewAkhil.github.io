    <p>Hello there! My name is Akhil Mathew and I am in CSCE 445. The reason I decided to 
        take this class is because I have always been interested in media as it has always been a 
        part of my life. Whether it be through movies, TV shows, or music, media is a major part of my life
        and I would love to learn more about it and how we are affected by different kinds of media.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Media I frequently use:

            <li><b>Games</b>
                <ul>

                    <li>Madden</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Music</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rock</li>
                    <li>Rap</li>
                    <li>Indie</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>A challenge I face in my content consumption is over consumption of media. 
        When I am consuming different kinds of media, it feels like I am separated
        from reality and put into a world where I can relax and enjoy. It becomes
        so enjoyable that I spend more time consuming media than I would like.
